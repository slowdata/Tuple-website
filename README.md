## Using Tailwind CSS Playground

A simple starter project for playing around with Tailwind in a proper PostCSS environment.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/tailwindcss/tuple-website.git

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install

   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run serve

   yarn run serve
   ```

   Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

## Building for production

Even though this isn't necessarily a starter kit for a proper project, we've included an example of setting up both [Purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) to optimize your CSS for production.

To build an optimized version of your CSS, simply run:

```
npm run production

yarn run production
```

After that's done, check out `./public/build/tailwind.css` to see the optimized output.
